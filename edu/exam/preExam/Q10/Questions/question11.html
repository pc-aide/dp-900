  <h2>Question 11</h2>
  <p>You plan to deploy an app. The app requires a nonrelational data service that will provide latency guarantees of less than 10-ms for reads and writes. What should you include in the solution?</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>Azure Cosmos DB: The read latency for all consistency levels is always guaranteed to be less than 10 milliseconds at the 99th percentile. The average read latency, at the 50th percentile, is typically 4 milliseconds or less. The write latency for all consistency levels is always guaranteed to be less than 10 milliseconds at the 99th percentile. The average write latency, at the 50th percentile, is usually 5 milliseconds or less. Azure Cosmos DB accounts that span several regions and are configured with strong consistency are an exception to this guarantee.</p>
