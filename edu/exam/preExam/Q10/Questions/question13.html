    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>1 - Atomicity: Atomicity ensures that each transaction is treated as a single unit, which either succeeds completely or fails completely. Therefore, it is not correct to say that all statements in a transaction must complete successfully; the transaction may fail. Thus, the correct answer is No.</p>
    <p>2 - Consistency: Consistency ensures that transactions take the database from one valid state to another. Data changes must be logged and accounted for as part of maintaining consistency. Hence, the correct answer is Yes.</p>
    <p>3 - Isolation: Isolation guarantees that processes see only data in a consistent state during the transaction. Thus, the correct answer is Yes.</p>
