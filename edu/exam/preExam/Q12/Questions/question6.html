      <p><strong>Y</strong> - OLTP systems are designed to efficiently process and store transactions, as well as query transactional data. They handle a large number of short online transaction processing requests.</p>
      <p><strong>N</strong> - OLAP systems are optimized for querying and reporting large datasets, typically using less normalized data, making them highly efficient for reads but less efficient for writes.</p>
      <p><strong>Y</strong> - Data warehouses are optimized for read operations, designed to store large amounts of historical data for analysis, often using OLAP technologies.</p>
