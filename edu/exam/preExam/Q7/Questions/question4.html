    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>Column-family database is the low latency store type. Examples include recommendations, personalization, sensor data, telemetry, messaging, social media analytics, web analytics, activity monitoring, weather, and other time-series data.</p>

    <p>The diffirence is:
      - Key/value: in order to modify a value (either partially or completely), an application must overwrite the existing data for the entire value
      - Columnar: columns are divided into groups known as column families, and Within a column family, new columns can be added dynamically, and rows can be sparse SO take less time for modification.
      The answer is correct, C - columnar</p>
      <p>It is not a key/value store as it stores data in hash tables, which is basically "unreadable" as it is a arbitrary set of values. K/V store is best for simple lookups using the value of a key, and is absolutely not suited for a commerce system,</p>
