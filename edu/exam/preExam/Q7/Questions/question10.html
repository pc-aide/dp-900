    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>You implement ADLS as a Storage Account. Azure Data Lake Storage is a type of storage account in Azure, specifically optimized for big data analytics workloads. When you create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account, you are essentially creating a specialized type of Storage Account with additional capabilities tailored for data lake scenarios. When you create an ADLS Gen2 account, it is provisioned under the hood as a hierarchical namespace on top of Blob storage, which is part of Azure Storage. This means that you can use your Azure Data Lake Storage account to store and analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data, leveraging features such as fine-grained access control, hierarchical namespaces, and integration with big data analytics services like Azure Databricks, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Synapse Analytics. <br/><br/>

    The question is asking of GEN1 or GEN2 as two different things. If we think of GEN1 it is a service in Azure, but if GEN 2 it sits on top of Blobs which is part of Azure Container so that would make sense for go with the YES in the last option.</p>
