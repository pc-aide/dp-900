    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>You can control costs for a dedicated SQL pool by pausing the resource when it is not in use. For example, if you won't be using the database during the night and on weekends, you can pause it during those times and resume it during the day. For more information, see Pause and resume compute in dedicated SQL pool via the Azure portal.</p>
