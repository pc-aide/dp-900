    <p>Time series data is a set of values organized by time. Time series databases typically collect large amounts of data in real time from a large number of sources. Updates are rare, and deletes are often done as bulk operations. Although the records written to a time-series database are generally small, there are often a large number of records, and total data size can grow rapidly. Telemetry and time series databases are an append-only collection of objects. Telemetry databases efficiently index data in a variety of column stores and in-memory structures, making them the optimal choice for storing and analyzing vast quantities of telemetry and time series data.</p>
