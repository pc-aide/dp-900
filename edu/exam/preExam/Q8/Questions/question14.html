    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>A data warehouse gathers data from many different sources within an organization. The focus of a data warehouse is to provide answers to complex queries. The primary purpose of a Data Warehouse is for ANALYTICS. To provide/gain insight from very large datasets. Data is often aggregated from various data sources. A data warehouse is a large, centralized repository of data that is specifically designed for reporting and analysis. The primary purpose of a data warehouse is to store historical data from multiple sources in a single location, in a format that makes it easy to query and analyze. This data is typically read-only, meaning that it is not intended for transactional use. Instead, it is used for reporting and analysis, such as generating business intelligence reports, performing data mining and modeling, and supporting decision-making processes. Data warehousing also includes transforming data from various sources into a consistent format, making it easy for users to query and analyze data from multiple systems.</p>
