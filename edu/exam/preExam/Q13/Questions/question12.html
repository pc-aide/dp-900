        <label><input type="radio" name="question12_1_radio" value="No"> No</label><br><br>
    
        <p>Key/value data stores are highly optimized for complex queries that contain multiple joins:</p>
        <label><input type="radio" name="question12_2_radio" value="Yes"> Yes</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="question12_2_radio" value="No"> No</label><br><br>
    
        <p>A relational database is commonly used to store & query structured data:</p>
        <label><input type="radio" name="question12_3_radio" value="Yes"> Yes</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="question12_3_radio" value="No"> No</label>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>In a relational database, the schema is indeed defined before data is written to the table, ensuring data consistency and integrity.</p>
        <p>Key/value data stores are not optimized for complex queries with multiple joins. They are designed for high-speed data retrieval based on a key, focusing on simplicity and performance rather than complex query operations.</p>
        <p>A relational database is commonly used for storing and querying structured data due to its support for complex queries and data relationships.</p>
