    <h2>Question 19</h2>
    <p>A bank needs to ensure that a transaction involving debiting funds from a source account and crediting the same funds to a destination account must complete both actions. If either action fails to complete, the other action must fail.</p>
    <p>Of which ACID semantic is this an example?</p>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pc-aide/dp-900/refs/heads/main/edu/exam/preExam/Q13/img/q19.jpg">
        <p>Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged</p>
        <p>Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one consistent state to another, preserving database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules</p>
        <p>Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially</p>
        <p>Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash).</p>
