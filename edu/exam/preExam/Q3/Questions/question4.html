  <p>What is a characteristic of batch processing?</p>

  <form>
    <label><input type="radio" name="question4_radio" value="A"> A. The data ingested during batch processing must be processed as soon as the data is received.</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="question4_radio" value="B"> B. Large datasets must be split into batches of less than 1 GB before the data can be processed.</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="question4_radio" value="C"> C. There is a noticeable time delay between ingesting data and obtaining the data processing results.</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="question4_radio" value="D"> D. Batch processing can only process data that is structured.</label>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pc-aide/dp-900/main/edu/exam/preExam/Q3/img/q4.png">
    <p>The fundamental requirement of such batch processing engines is to scale out computations to handle a large volume of data. Unlike real-time processing, batch processing is expected to have latencies (the time between data ingestion and computing a result) that measure in minutes to hours.</p>
