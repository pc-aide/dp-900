        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>A transactional workload means that over time, the database is getting requests for data and various changes to that data from different users. The modifications that are made are known as transactions. For example, a transactional workload is built to aid in transactions such as in banking or accounting systems.</p>
