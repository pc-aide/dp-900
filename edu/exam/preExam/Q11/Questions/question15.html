      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Y</strong> - Azure Data Lake Storage can be used as a staging area for ingested data before the data is converted into a format suitable for performing analytics. It allows you to store and analyze large amounts of data, and it is optimized for big data analytics workloads.</p>
      <p><strong>N</strong> - Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines. It does not use a massively parallel processing architecture by default but allows you to perform complex data integration and transformation tasks by integrating with other Azure services.</p>
      <p><strong>N</strong> - Azure HDInsight is designed for big data analytics workloads and does not enable you to build tabular models from multiple data sources to support OLAP queries. Azure Analysis Services is a service that you can use to create and manage tabular models for OLAP.</p>
